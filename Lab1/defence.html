                <p>  The Python standard library is a vast collection of built-in modules and functions included with every 
                    Python installation. It provides standardized solutions for a wide range of common programming tasks, covering 
                    everything from basic data types and file I/O to networking, database interactions, and web development. 
                    This extensive functionality is often summarized by the phrase "batteries included". </p></li>

                <p>  The C++ Standard Library is a comprehensive collection of classes, functions, and templates 
                    that are an integral part of the C++ ISO Standard. 
                    It provides fundamental functionality for C++ programming, ensuring portability 
                    and efficiency across different compilers and systems. </p></li>

                <p>  The Java standard library, officially known as the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) API or the Java class library,
                    is a comprehensive collection of pre-written classes and interfaces that are part of the Java Development Kit (JDK). 
                    It provides essential, ready-to-use functionality for common programming tasks. </p></li>
